## Getting started  

### Use it right now  

Open the Bremertown Chatroom at **[chat.bremertown.com](http://chat.bremertown.com)** and give it a try.  

Because this project is rarely used at this time, I can't afford to pay $7/month for a Heroku Hobby dyno. That is why the `chat.bremertown.com` subdomain does not use https. If you would like to access the chatroom using https, please go to **[https://bremertown.herokuapp.com/](https://bremertown.herokuapp.com/)**.

### Deploy your own copy  

Simply and easily deploy your very own copy of this chat system to Heroku using this button:

## About  

Bremertown Chatroom is another chat. The goal of this chatroom project is to be simple but look nice. Enter a nickname and begin chatting instantly. No password required, no sign-up process, no database, no centrally saved chat history.  

Inspired by the city of [Bremerton, WA, USA](http://www.ci.bremerton.wa.us/), but open to everyone.
